# 🤖 MEGA-ULTRA-ROBOTER-KI
## 🚀 PayPal Revenue Maximization System

**STATUS: LIVE (PRODUCTION)** 🟢

This system is a fully autonomous revenue maximization bot connected to the PayPal Live API. It monitors transactions in real-time and uses AI (Claude/Grok/Local Core) to analyze sales and suggest upsells.

### ✅ Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Checks PayPal for new transactions every 10 seconds.
- **AI Analysis:** Uses Claude 3 Opus or Grok Beta to analyze buyer behavior.
- **Local Core Fallback:** Continues to work even if AI credits run out.
- **Secure:** API keys are stored locally in `env.ini` and never uploaded to Git.

### 🛠️ How to Start
1. Double-click **`START_ROBOTER.bat`** on your Desktop.
2. Keep the black window open.
3. The Dashboard will open automatically in your browser (`http://localhost:8502`).

### 🔑 Configuration
- **PayPal Keys:** Managed in `env.ini` (Live Mode).
- **AI Keys:** Managed in `env.ini` (Claude/Grok).

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- The system is locked to **LIVE MODE**. All revenue numbers are real.
- The `[TEST]` button in the dashboard is only for checking AI connectivity.
- Real transactions will appear as `[PAYPAL REAL]` in the logs.
